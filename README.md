# portfolio

Using HTML and CSS to create a portfolio, that is responsive and (should) be accesseble for various readers using the web.
Challenging work that took me 10+ hours a day to create from a design that was given using Figma. 
First time encounting the amount of code and also choosing and changing codes in HTML and CSS ones coming far, due to the accessable-part. 

This project will be a continuing project due to it not being done, both with in HTML and also the design. It can then be surely tested for accessebilites. 

I found the most challenging part was the CSS and to work from a small laptop, I could see how it would be helpful having two screens or lager version for coming future. Parts being to style for large desktop I decided to not focus on, and aimed for what I actually can visualize while due to it being a learning process. Also the the time it asked to get all details for flexbox, grid, fitting every component that where required for this page are still hard for me at this stage. I learned more about CSS but also HTML which was well needed in week 4 in this boocamp.
