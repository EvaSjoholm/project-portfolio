# portfolio

Using HTML and CSS to create a portfolio, that is responsive and (should) be accesseble for various readers using the web.
Challenging work that took me 10+ hours a day to create from a design that was given using Figma. 
First time encounting the amount of code and also choosing and changing codes in HTML and CSS ones coming far, due to the accessable-part. 

This project will be a continuing project due to it not being done, both with in HTML and also the design. It can then be surely tested for accessebilites. 

I found the most challenging part to work from a small laptop and trying to figure out the sizing for larger desktop and if the used CSS is actually correct so I skipped that and aimed for what I actually can visualize while working. Also the the time it asked to get all details that where required where not managable for me at this stage. I learned more about CSS but also HTML which was well needed in week 4 in this boocamp.
